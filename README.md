Iris+ Android application for now shut down Iris by Lowes Home Automation system

I will not be able to provide any support for trying to get it to compile and run so you are on your own here. If anyone decides to contribute and make it work with the new Arcus system (Iris released as open source by Lowes) I may be able to jump in as well. Enjoy!
